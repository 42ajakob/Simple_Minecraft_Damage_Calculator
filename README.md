# Simple-Damage-Calculator-for-Minecraft
A simple damage calculator for Minecraft written in python (If you want a efficent calculator written in Assembly. Cry).
Made for older versions for example 1.9.X.
The specific reason I made this calculator is because I couldn't find a good one that can take custom Damage values and disregard Armor Thoughness.

Includes:
- Armor Damage Reduction
- Protection Enchantment Reduction
- Absorption I Effect
- Resistence I Effect
